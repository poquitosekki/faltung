Sekki :), contact me on instagram if you wanna know more about me `@itzsekki`.

## Origin

If you really know me you're probably aware that I'm dogshit at french.

So after a lot of research I stumbled upon Steven Krashen's input hypothesis and it really makes sense at least for me because i acquired English naturally over the year by getting a lot of exposure & input in the language.

There are multiple Methods that are based on the input style :
  * AJATT
  * Antimoon
  * Refold

I do a combination of these 3 methods i guess.

I was reading an article on wikipedia about [Proteinfaltung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinfaltung) & i think that learning a language is just taking a lot of input over a period of time and just let the information `fold` so your mind create a model for the language similar to the 3D shape in the Protein Folding process.

So enough rambling let's explore the resources.
